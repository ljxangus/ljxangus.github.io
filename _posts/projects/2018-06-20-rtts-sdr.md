## Overview

A real-time wireless system implemented on PC-USRP using GNURadio, targeting to provide TSN (Time-Sensitive Networking) service to the upper layer with high accuracy synchronization.

## Key Features

- Achieving synchronization among nodes to within **100ns**
- End-to-end latency as low as **3.75ms**
- Easy-deployable and reconfigurable for time-critical wireless applications
- Full-stack implementation from physical layer to application

## Technical Specifications

### Synchronization Mechanism
The system implements precision time protocol (PTP) over wireless, achieving sub-microsecond synchronization accuracy through:
- High-precision timestamping at the physical layer
- Clock skew estimation and compensation
- Adaptive filtering for clock drift correction

### Performance Metrics
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Synchronization Accuracy | < 100ns |
| End-to-End Latency | 3.75ms |
| Supported Nodes | Up to 10 |
| Frequency Band | 2.4GHz / 5GHz |

## Applications

This system is suitable for various time-critical industrial IoT applications including:
- Industrial automation and control
- Robotics coordination
- Real-time video streaming
- Haptic feedback systems
