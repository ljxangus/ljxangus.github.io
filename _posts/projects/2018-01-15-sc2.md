## Overview

The DARPA Spectrum Collaboration Challenge (SC2) was the first-of-its-kind collaborative machine-learning competition to overcome scarcity in the radio frequency (RF) spectrum. Our team built a real-time wireless system leveraging Artificial Intelligence to access the spectrum without interfering with other signals.

## Key Achievements

- Built a real-time wireless system that leverages Artificial Intelligence for spectrum access
- Cooperated with the research group from Northwestern University
- Qualified for Preliminary Event 1 & 2 (PE1 & PE2)
- Presented at events hosted in Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory

## Technical Approach

The challenge involved developing collaborative radio systems that could share spectrum efficiently without causing interference. Our system utilized machine learning algorithms to:
- Detect and classify nearby signals
- Dynamically adjust transmission parameters
- Negotiate spectrum usage with other systems in real-time

## Impact

This project demonstrated the potential of AI-driven spectrum sharing to revolutionize wireless communications and address the growing spectrum scarcity problem.
